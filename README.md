## Built with

Clapgrow is built using the [Frappe Framework](https://frappeframework.com) - an open-source full stack development framework.

These are some of the tools it's built on:

- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)

The frontend is built using React and the following tools:

- [frappe-react-sdk](https://github.com/nikkothari22/frappe-react-sdk) - simple React hooks to interface with a Frappe framework backend - built and maintained by The Commit Company.
- [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/api)

## Installation

Since Clapgrow is a Frappe app, it can be installed via [frappe-bench](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/bench) on your local machine or on your production site.

Once you have [setup your bench](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/installation) and your [site](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/tutorial/install-and-setup-bench), you can install the app via the following commands:

```bash
bench get-app https://github.com/{username:password}@clapgrow/clapgrow_app_v2.git
```

```bash
bench --site <yoursite.name> install-app clapgrow_app
```

Post this, you can access Clapgrow on your Frappe site at the `/clapgrow` endpoint (e.g. https://yoursite.com/clapgrow).

### Local development setup

To set up your local development environment, make sure that you have enabled [developer mode](https://frappeframework.com/how-to-enable-developer-mode-in-frappe) in your Frappe site config.

You also need to disable CSRF (add `ignore_csrf: 1` in your `site_config.json`) since the React web server will not have any CSRF token in live reload mode. Please note that this is only for the local dev setup - not meant for Production.

You can start the React live web server by:

```bash
cd frappe-bench/apps/clapgrow_app
yarn dev
```

Your local dev server would be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Reporting Bugs

If you find any bugs, feel free to report them here on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/clapgrow/clapgrow_app_v2/issues). Make sure you share enough information (app screenshots, browser console screenshots, stack traces, etc) for project maintainers to replicate your bug.
